## Background

Neuroimaging visualization forms the centrepiece of quality control, and
interpretation and communication of results. Often, these images and
figures are produced by manually changing settings on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUI). There now exist many well-documented code-based brain
visualisation tools that allow users to programmatically generate
publication-ready figures directly within environments such as R, Python
and MATLAB. Compared to figures generated using GUIs, programmatic tools
are more replicable, flexible, interactive, and integrated with the
scientific process. This article reviews the advantages of learning and
using programmatic neuroimaging visualization tools and provides a list
of tools across programming environments. Finally, we introduce examples
of specific R and Python tools for visualization of voxel, vertex,
region-of-interest, and edge level data..
